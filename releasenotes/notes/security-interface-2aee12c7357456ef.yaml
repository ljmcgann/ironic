    Adds version 1.69 of the REST API, which exposes the ``security_interface``
    field of the node resource. This version also exposes
    ``default_security_interface`` and ``enable_security_interfaces`` fields
    of the driver resource.
    There is 1 available security interface:
    * ``noop``: This interface provides nothing regarding security.
    A security interface can be set when creating or updating a node. Enabled
    security interfaces are defined via the
    ``[DEFAULT]/enabled_security_interfaces`` configuration option. A default
    interface for a created node can be specified with
    ``[DEFAULT]/default_security_interface`` configuration option.
